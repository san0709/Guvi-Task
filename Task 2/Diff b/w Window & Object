Window :
The Window interface represents a window containing a DOM document

Document:
A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document.

Difference between Window and Document:

1)Window represents the browser window in we  are seeing the content. 
2)The properties related to it are stored in the window object.
3)It is loaded before the document because window contains document. 
4)The window is the global element for all objects, functions, etc.
5)It is an object of the browser.We can access document object properties inside the window.
6)SYNTAX:  window:{
        document:{properties}
    } Example: window.document.title will return the title of the document.

1)Document reprsents the document loaded inside the window or browser. 
2)The properties related to it are stored in the document object.
3)It is loaded after the loading window because the window contains a document. 
4)It is the root element of the document object model.
5)It is an object of window.We can not access windows objects properties inside the document.		
6)SYNTAX: document:{ properties} Example: document.title will return the title of the document
